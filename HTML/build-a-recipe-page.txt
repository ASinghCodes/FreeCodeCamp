    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No discipline</li>
      <li>No sense of time</li>
      <li>A heaping amount of procrastination</li>
      <li>An almost childlike innocence to the reality of the world</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Think motivation is what you need and not discipline.</li>
      <li>Think that time will go by slowly.</li>
      <li>Procrastinate on progressing your skills because undiagnosed anxiety makes you think you're going to fail before you even try.</li>
      <li>Think that the world is kind and understanding rather than cruel and cutthroat.</li>
    </ol>
